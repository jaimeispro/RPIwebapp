# RPIwebapp

-This project develops a security system based on an Android App, Raspberry Pi, a camera, and PaaS.
-When the RPi Camera detects motion, it takes a photo of the instance, and turns on a sensor light
signaling the alarm is on. It then sends a JSONRequest to the database, updating the values to alarm1,
which will trigger an update to the website using AJAX to refresh the page with the new value, and an
updated log table. The user is also able to change the sensor values using the android App.
- This project was more about how to work with embedded systems, sending values to and from a
database, and how you're able to use a variety of different tools/languages to make an application.
